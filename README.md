A helping tool for the disabled people, especially the blind.

project is divided into 2 parts -

1)With the help of a camera accessory, videos/pictures of any room are taken and the objects present in the frame are detected. Then JSON data is parsed and converted into speech for the people to hear it. This can be done automatically or with the help of a physical switch. Thus the control is in the hand of the user.

2)We are trying to find the distance of any particular object present in the room with the help of the images/video taken from different angles and perspective. It gives an approximate depth value.
