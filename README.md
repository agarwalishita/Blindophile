# HackVsit

Our inspiration was to create a helping tool for the disabled people, especially the blind.
So we created a software that would help the blind people in realizing the environment around them.

Our project is divided into 2 parts -

1. With the help of a camera accessory, we are taking videos/pictures of any room and detecting the objects present in the frame. The we are parsing the JSON data and converting it into speech for the people to hear it. This can be done automatically or with the help of a physical switch. Thus the control is in the hand of the user.

2. We are trying to find the distance of any particular object present in the room with the help of the images/video taken from different angles and perspective. It gives us an approximate depth value.

The next part is too develop this into a complete project. That also includes the hardware part of the model.
See you next time!
